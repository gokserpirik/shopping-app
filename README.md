A food ordering app UI which has a main page, list category page, choose delivery market page etc.

You can also check aboutApp.dart!

Used Flutter/Dart

Used Getir's color palette. Getir is a big company in Turkey which also delivers food etc.

### Disclaimer
This app UI does NOT have a business side. Just maden to create something and improve/train my coding skills. 

## Getting Started

Used Flutter/Dart

Used Getir's color palette. Getir is a big company in Turkey which also delivers food etc.

Used 	google_fonts: ^2.1.0 and font_awesome_flutter: ^9.1.0

You can check color palette in "colors.dart"
 

## Samples
The random button on bottom-right gives you a random food. I personally always wanted smth like that in apps so added it to a ui project hahaha (YEP, it works as much as I could make.)
