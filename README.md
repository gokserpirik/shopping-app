# shopping app

A shopping app UI with few pages and less details. Because there is no actual work :)

Used Flutter/Dart

Used Getir's color palette. Getir is a big company in Turkey which also delivers food etc.

### Disclaimer
This app UI does NOT have a business side. Just maden to create something and improve/train my coding skills.
